title: Stem up or stem down?
---

Most notes have *stems* that are straight lines pointing up or down.  Here are
the rules about stems:

* When the note is **under** the middle line of the staff, draw the stem pointing **up**.
* When the note is **on** the middle line or **over** it, draw the stem pointing **down**.

Practice drawing the stems on the bass clef notes below:

Stems look the same in the treble clef.  Practice drawing them on all the notes
below.  Then draw all of the notes again by yourself!
