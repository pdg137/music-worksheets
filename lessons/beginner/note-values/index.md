title: Note values
---

To make music, we need to play some notes for a longer time and some for a
shorter time.  The time that a note takes is called its *value*, and we draw
notes to indicate the value:

|---|---|
|<span class="unicode-notes">𝅝</span> | A *whole note* is usually the longest note you will see.  Each whole note gets four beats.  Count it as "1-2-3-4". |
|<span class="unicode-notes">𝅗𝅥𝅗𝅥</span> | There are two *half notes* in a whole note.  Each half note gets two beats: "1-2 1-2". |
| <span class="unicode-notes">𝅘𝅥𝅘𝅥𝅘𝅥𝅘𝅥</span> | There are four *quarter notes* in a whole note.  Each quarter note gets one beat.  Count it as "1 1 1 1". |
